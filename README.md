# EVKG
This is the repository for the paper "EVKG: An Interlinked and Interoperable Electric Vehicle Knowledge Graph for Smart Transportation System", which is submitted to TGIS.
## About this project
In this work, inspired by the challenges faced by EV charging systems and recent advancements in KG, we develop an EV-centric knowledge graph, called EVKG, that serves as an interlinked, cross-domain, scalable, and open data repository to help pace toward more smart EV knowledge management system. Meanwhile, this work will provide an ontology for various EV-related knowledge. which enables rigorous logical interpretation and machine-actionability. With the proposed ontology, EVKG would enable an effective integration of critical spatial and semantic information of electric vehicles including the EV charging infrastructures, the electricity transmission network,
and the electric vehicle adoptions at different spatial scales.
